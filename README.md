# Design Patterns

Design patterns help you choose design alternatives that make a system reusable and avoid alternatives that compromise reusability.

> [!NOTE]
> Program to an interface, not an implementation

Before we dive in, please have in mind that learning these patterns can be slow and confunsing in your first tries. Please be patient, because once you grasp them, it'll be worth it.

Design patterns can be divided amoung 3 categories:

- Creational
  
- Structural
  
- Behavioral

With creational patterns, we can create objects to increase our code flexibility and reusability; for structural, we assemble objects and classes to form larger structures, while keeping theses structures flexible and efficient; and last, but not least, for behavioral, we think about algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities amoung objects.

Let's start with creational patterns!

## Creational Patterns

As said before, this kind of patterns aims in the object creation mechanisms to enhance our code by giving it more flexibility and reusability. Also descreases the number of lines of our code, which is also a good thing :smile:

The patterns are:

- **Factory Method** (or Virtual Constructor)
  
- **Abstract Factory**
  
- **Builder**
  
- **Prototype**
  
- **Singletone**
  

### Factory Method (or Virtual Constructor)

Is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
